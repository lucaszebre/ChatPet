**Note:** ChatPet is a **school portfolio project** developed for educational purposes. We are committed to protecting your privacy while demonstrating best practices in data handling.

## 1. Information We Collect

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide the chatbot service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also inform you why we're collecting it and how it will be used.

The information we may collect includes:

- Account information (username, email) if you choose to create an account
- Chat history to provide context for the AI-powered pet advice
- Usage data to improve the service

## 2. Google Account Integration

You can sign up with your Google account, allowing ChatPet to prefill your account username with your name and public profile picture. This integration is optional and uses Google's secure OAuth authentication.

## 3. Data Retention and Protection

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with the chatbot service. The data we store is protected within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.

As an educational project, we may periodically review and update our data retention practices. You may request deletion of your data at any time.

## 4. Data Sharing

We don't share any personally identifying information publicly or with third parties, except when required by law.

**AI Processing:** Your chat messages are processed by AI services to generate pet care advice. These interactions are handled securely and are not sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 5. Data Controller and Processor

ChatPet acts as a data controller and a data processor with regard to the personal data processed through our services, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As a school project, we follow data protection best practices to demonstrate responsible data handling.

## 6. External Links

Our application may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You have the right to:

- Access your personal data
- Request correction of your data
- Request deletion of your data
- Opt out of data collection (though this may limit functionality)

## 8. Educational Purpose Disclaimer

As a school portfolio project, ChatPet is designed to demonstrate AI integration and full-stack development skills. While we take data protection seriously, please be aware that this is an educational project and not a commercial service.

## 9. Acceptance of Terms

Your continued use of ChatPet will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact the project developers.
